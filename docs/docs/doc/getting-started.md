For example, we choose `Mock JSON`

We will complete a `JSON` rule through` snippet`, and we can quickly jump through `Tab`. The usage of `` ES6-like strings '' here is a grammar extended on the basis of `whistle`, which can support multiple lines of content written directly into the rules.

Then we open the browser and visit `https://www.github.com/alibaba/lightproxy`

You can see that the returned content is the `JSON` we wrote. The returned` header` also contains the `my-test-head` that we wrote. At the same time,` __lightproxy-real-url__` and other `header` can also help us quickly locate The actual file.

## More rules

In addition to the multi-line string syntax, `LightProxy` syntax is` whistle` syntax, you can directly refer to the `whistle` rules document: [https://wproxy.org/whistle/principle.html](https://wproxy.org/whistle/principle.html)
